# Fire Alarm

The apartment building I live in has very sensitive smoke detectors in apartments that are rented out to short-term tenants, which trigger a very loud alarm in the whole building. This has caused hour-long alarm sessions, including waking up from sleep because somebody left the humidifier on during the night. Usually, travelers are confused about what to do and just wait it out.

This web app informs foreigners about what to do during a fire alarm and allows them to leave a message in case it is a 100% false alarm.
